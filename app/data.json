	"description": "After years of congratulating each other’s film and music taste, curiosity got the better of Richard Bailey (Proem), Don Gunn (Bleen), and Tanner Volz (Anklebiter). They threw each other some remix kits and yelled ideas across social media platforms. dx.rxt was born. The work is cinematic, idiosyncratic, a little brutal, a little beautiful. Proem’s dark rhythmic washes, anklebiter’s wistful melodics, Bleen’s percussive mayhem, the best of every project in uncomfortable harmony. Something something blahblah... writing about music.... the dumbs. Also... farting chicken",
